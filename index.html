                    Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan, better known online as kruthers. <br />
                    I am a 19-year-old UK based developer and gamer who works in a wide range of languages and helps manage and administrate 
                    multiple gaming servers and Discords.

                    <h1>Projects</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ever since I started programming, I have been working on a range of different projects in different languages, including Minecraft mods, 
                        plugins and maps. I have also worked on a few different discord bots and websites.
                        <br /> As of more recently I have started sharing some of these projects online, these include a couple of plugins and a few maps that 
                        I have led/ worked on and are now on realms.<br/>
                        I also have experience in discord bot design, discord Management and website design. This site was designed almost enterally from scratch!

                    <h1>Gaming & Comunties</h1>
                    <p>
                        Almost all of my interests stem from the games I play, these including Minecraft, Gary's Mod, Space Engineers, Kerbal Space Flight just to list 
                        a few of my favourites.<br /><br /> 
                        From within these games I have also met lot of people and joined communities which I am now parts of, one of the first one of these was 
                        <a href="https://gm4.co">Gamemode 4</a>. Within the Gamemode 4 community I started off as a normal player and have since become one of the main 
                        system admins responsible for keeping the server running and I also help moderate it. <br />
                        Another one of these communities is Team GFD where I am an admin and the provider of servers. I have also more recently help make a discord bot for 
                        our discord and started work on making a website for us. As a community we mainly are centred around Minecraft and its endless possibilities, but 
                        we have regular gamenights where we play a range of different games. For these I am the most regular host/organiser for them.

                    <h1>Server Hosting</h1>
                    <p>
                        Over time I have also started hosting and running my own servers in a range of games. I have been hosting servers since 2014/2015 and got my own 
                        machine for it back in 2017. Since then I have started hosting my own websites, bots for discord and a wide range of other services for use by me 
                        and my friends.
                        <br /><br />
                        As of recently I also have acquired a dedicated server in a Data centre to allow me to expand my services and their performance.
