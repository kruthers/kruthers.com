                <h1>The map</h1>
                <p>
                    Bolt is a fast-paced bow game with a general aim of shooting each other to achieve a range of objectives in 5 different gamemodes across 8 maps! 
                    As well as this, there are a lot of options from respawn time to killstreak items, and with most modes having customizable win conditions, you 
                    can adjust the setting for flags required to win on Capture the Flag, kills needed on Free For All, and more! In the game, there is a range of 
                    killstreak items, such as slime traps - perfect for annoying opponents - and paint traps which work like landmines. You can also get special 
                    items that wipe out every player! Be careful with how you use them however, as they even kill your own teammates!
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h3><i class="fas fa-flag"></i> Capture the flag</h3>
                <p> 
                    Capture the Flag is a race to capture the enemy's flag and bring it to your base. But watch out - while you do this, the enemy is rushing 
                    to capture yours! Whatever you do, don't get shot while you have the flag; you don't want to let the enemy get it back!
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-map-marker"></i> Capture the Point</h3>
                <p> 
                    In Capture the Point, your goal is to deplete the enemy's health by standing on their point! Watch out though, as they are trying 
                    to deplete your health, too! The more people you have standing on it, the faster their health will drop, but there will be fewer people 
                    defending yours! Drain the enemy's health to 0 to win.
                </p>
                <h3>üèπ Free For all</h3>
                <p> 
                    Free For All is as it says on the tin! A free for all to get the most kills, with no objectives and safe zones, just run around and shoot 
                    everyone you see to get the most kills! Watch out for people trying to do the same to you though!
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-snowman"></i>Freeze Tag</h3>
                <p> 
                    In Freeze Tag, the aim is to freeze the whole enemy team by shooting them, watch out though as they want to freeze you too, and you are no 
                    good to your team frozen! Don‚Äôt worry if you get frozen though, your teammates can unfreeze you. But, be aware! While unfreezing someone, 
                    you can get frozen too! Win the game by freezing every player from the opposing team.
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-skull"></i>Team Death Match</h3>
                <p> 
                    Team Deathmatch is a game of death where both teams are fighting for kills, that's all! No objectives or flags. Just a war to get the 
                    most kills, but watch out not to blow up your teammates as that gives the enemy team points!

                <h1>What i did</h1>
                <h2>Project Lead</h2>
                <p>
                    Very early into this projects life I become the project lead when the other people leading it had other projects come up. From there I organised 
                    the team responsible for working on this map and we started work with planning. We originally came up with about 12 different gamemodes from 
                    which we chose the final classic 5. Over this project‚Äôs first year of development I stayed as the project lead until the map realised onto 1.14 
                    Realms.
                    <br />
                    After 1.16 came out I re-started this project to work on adding new maps, reworked the kill handling making it way more arcuate. This time 
                    however we had a new set of builders to work on it. I had also learnt a lot more about commands and performance and was able to 
                    apply this to make the functions a lot cleaner and easier to read and understand.

                </p>
                <h2>Lead Developer/ Programmer</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to disagreements a couple of other people that were going to work on this map had I ended up taking lead on the coding to integrate all the 
                    different mechanisms. Now that I have done the 1.16 update, I ended up rewriting most of the code meaning now I am now the sole programmer on 
                    this project.
                    <br />
                    Within the project we have 5 different gamemodes, each one with their own unique set of challenges. Freeze tag was by far the hardest as it had 
                    to use its own kill handling as players don‚Äôt respawn in this mode they instead freeze.
                    <br />
                    As said before the whole game is built around a custom kill handling system which is responsible for identifying and tracking all arrows in the 
                    game. This includes checking for friendly fire and making sure everyone does die when shot once because of this system we also have a complex 
                    respawn system that can handle multiple spawn location and respawn delays in a dynamic way. On top of this, we also have explosive power ups 
                    that track who dropped them and who detonated them as well as different delays and radius.
                </p>
                <h2>Building</h2>
                <p>
                    As well as programming i also took a stab at building on this map and designed the layout and theme for Cavens, one of the other builders 
                    detailed it I also then went a designed the new lobby based of a original  concept that got rejected which someone else added the detail to.
                </p>
