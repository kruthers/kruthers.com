                <h1>The map</h1>
                <p>
                    Security Guard 2 is a reimaging of the orginal <a href="https://dpeabody20.wixsite.com/dtplayers/post/security-guard"> Security guard Map</a>. <br />
                    This new version has a masive new map, new relics, better AI and more things todo. This includes new gamemodes new wepons and potions.<br />
                    The aim of the game is diffrent for the 2 teams. For the Theifs they need to try and steal all the required relics needed to escape, from here depending
                    on the gamemode you may then have to get out of the map via one of the emergency exits!<br />
                    A guards role is to stop as many relics getting stolen as possible by killing the theifs, both the AI and players! Be warned though the theifs have 2
                    buff potions at their disposal, 1 will teleport them to a random location around the map, the other will make them invsible. Dont worry though 
                    as you have a way to find them, in your hotbar you have a CCTV table that allows to to observe any cameras around the complex, but the theifs can 
                    break them to try and hide so keep up your game.<br />
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h3>The AI</h3>
                <p> 
                    The ai are villagers that can run around the map steeling relics, there difficault can be changes which changes how quick they move. They too 
                    have the 2 bug potions and can use them, as well as this they will run away from you so be allert!
                </p>
                <h3>The Map</h3>
                <p> 
                    The Map consits mostly of 2 floors, upper and lower across these each room has a them and there are short cuts the theifs can unlock up stealing
                    certen large relics, be carefull though as the guards can use them too! The relics are all representd by gold blocks on the ground which you shift
                    on to capture!

                <h1>What i did</h1>
                <h2>Code Assistant</h2>
                <p>
                    Throught the project i helped in a range of ways, this was mostly helping the 2 main coders who did not have much expereince in 1.16 commands.
                    Through out this i help optimise and get the AI working, The commands to get the relics breaking when stolen, the commands to return you to
                    you place when leaving CCTV and making sure you could see out of a CCTV camer correctly!
                </p>
                <h2>Building</h2>
                <p>
                    To help make things as quick as possible i generated the commands to help us create all the struture blocks for the relics and i also help destroy
                    and save around 50%. On top of this i also help build a few of them before they were destroyed.
                </p>
                <h2>Texturing</h2>
                <p>
                    For the map i helpd out with creating the textures of the menus in the lobby, and the textures used by the CCTV stands.
                </p>
