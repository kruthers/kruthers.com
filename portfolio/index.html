                        Gamemode 4 is a collection of datapacks that change and modify the game play experience. I helped add multiple modules over time and help update 
                        and bug fix even more. As part of Gamemode 4 there is a public server that contains most of the available modules in an open and welcoming 
                        environment to allow people to play together. As part of this server I am both a moderator and one of the core system admins in which I have 
                        created a range of plugins for and supporting datapacks.

                        PBE is a Minecraft dungeon crawler made using datapacks. It was designed to be a completive game which is completed in small groups of up to 4 
                        in a race to the end. It would have had a global scoreboard on a website. As part of the project we have a 100% custom head up display, this 
                        included custom health, armour, stamina and magic displays. As part of the system I was responsible for and make sure it felt dynamic and updated 
                        when expected. As part of the HUD I was also working on implementing a custom attack cool down display.
