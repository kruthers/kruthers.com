                <h1>The Bot</h1>
                <p>
                    The Team GFD discord bot was created to help organise and automate tasks in our discord. We host gamenights on a regular basis with normal 1 
                    every Saturday in which we mainly play free to play games or Minecraft. As well as this we will also host a gamenight on a Wednesday depending 
                    on who is around and about once to twice a month we host one on a Friday night where we play a paid for game like Garry's Mod.
                    <br />
                    In attempt to keep things more consistent and allow more people to host or know when they are going, we have created a bot to automate them.
                    <br />
                    This includes a system for people to subscribe for different roles and be notified what is going on. A system to automate my servers and 
                    changings the games on them.
                    <br />
                    The bot is also responsible for handling things like posting links to resource packs we use, information about the games we are playing including 
                    IPs, passwords, room codes and workshop links! (To do resource packs it also has a feature to allow us to automatically apply them to games and 
                    upload them to a file server with a file hash to fix issues with people not always downloading the resourcepack)
                    <br /><br />
                    To help keep the discord clean it is also been upgraded with moderation capabilityâ€™s and role, user and channel management.

                <h2>Lanugue</h2>
                <p>
                    The bot is written in typescript and we have gone for a design that has allowed us to make it as modular as possible. It is then compiled into 
                    JavaScript to run it.

                <h1>What i did</h1>
                <h2>Desginer & Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Within the bot I have been responsible for writing the system for internet facing with my gamming servers, the system which manages roles and a 
                    few admin commands. I have also been writing the core module of which most other modules will rely on. The main job of the core module is get 
                    stored data from a database and load in commonly used features and debug arguments
                    <br />
                    To do the role management system I have written a system to create a announcement message and format them in a given channel, from there it 
                    creates a message with a range of reactions added to it which people can then react to get a role or remove it.
                </p>
                <h2>Lead Storage manager</h2>
                <p>
                    As out of the developers I am one of the more experienced with MySQL, which we agreed was a better storage system due to the range of flexibility 
                    it gives us. Part of this is future website support and it means the dev and main bot can access the same data when running on different machines.
                    <br />
                    I also helped write all the different SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements as well as the code to run them and load data from them.
                </p>
                <h2>Hosting</h2>
                <p>
                    I am also responsible for the hosting of both the databases we are using and the Main bot which is running on the Team GFD discord Server. I am 
                    also hosting a few dev sites to allow viewing the data as a whole for debugging easier and am working on a full website to integrate with the bot.
