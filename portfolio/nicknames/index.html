                <h1>The Plugin</h1>
                <p>
                    Nicknames Ultimate is the ultimate nickname plugins containing a range of features surrounding changing your nickname!
                    <br />
                    This Nicknames plugin adds support for changing your name in every location including tab, chat and even your own player tag (coming soon). 
                    As well as all of this it also adds the support to toggle your nicknames prefix (if you have permission) so staff have the ability to hide!
                    <br />
                    On top of this I have also added a range of checks to prevent a wide ranges of issues including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fuzzy name matching. Ensure no one is portending to be someone else!</li>
                        <li>Fuzzy blocked word matching. Ensure no one is trying to use banned words in their nickname!</li>
                        <li>Fuzzy nickname matching. Ensure no one is trying to get the same nick as someone else, even when they are logged off!</li>
                        <li>Colour code checking. Ensure no one that is not meant to is using colour codes!</li>
                        <li>Format code checking. Ensure no one that is not meant to is using formatting codes!</li>
                        <li>
                            Join checking. Did someone have a nickname that is no longer valid? Thatâ€™s ok when they join it will confirm that their 
                            nickname is still valid (when the option is enabled).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>Other Features</h3>
                <p> 
                    Within the plugin there is a system to support multiple diffrent storage, currently setup for MySQL and local json storage!
                    <br />
                    The plugin also contains commands to look up who is currently using what nicknames. So if you not sure who someone is, just check with 
                    /realname [username]
                    <br />
                    There is then also a wide range of admin commands to reset plays nicknames, change them and even hide if you or someone else is nicknamed!
                </p>
                <h2>Highly Configurable!</h3>
                <p> 
                    The whole plugin is configurable, from who can do what with permissions, to the messages sent in response to commands. This means that you can controll
                    which features are enabled or disabled, which words are blocked and even if nicknames will be saved or checked on login!<br /><br />

                <h1>What i did</h1>
                <h2>Lead Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I originally created this plugin to be as a thank you for Gamemode 4 patrons on the public server by letting them nickname themselves! It very 
                    quickly grew from there and I ended up adding support for lots more. Throughout this project I learn about Minecraft packet sending, file storage 
                    and use MySQL from Java.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am also the main code contributor to this plugin with just a couple of people supporting with fixing a few nasty bugs which I have since 
                    re-written to prevent them from happening again
