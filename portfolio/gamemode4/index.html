                <h1>About Gamemode 4</h1>
                <p>
                    Gamemode 4 (Gm4) is a collection of carefully constructed datapack modules that can be easily added to your Minecraft world to 
                    add to your gameplay experience without the need for mods all while keeping the vanilla feel. The modules have been developed 
                    over the last 6+ years with us currently having over 50 different modules available! GM4 had developed a community discord with 
                    over 1000 members currently with a large amount of them being active on the discord.
                    <br />
                    Currently all the datapacks are now hosted on both the website and the GitHub making it easily then every to contribute with 
                    over 20 contributors so far. It has also have over 500 combined pull requests and issues.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h1>Public server</h1>
                <p> 
                    About a year after gm4 was born a public server was formed to allow members of the community to play with the modules and play 
                    with each other. The server has been running since 16th March 2015 and has is on its 6th season.
                    <br />
                    The server is a normal SMP (survival multiplayer) with limited changes and it being ran by a team of volunteers.

                <h1>My Contubtions</h1>
                <h2>Modules</h2>
                <p>
                    For the gm4 modules I have done a lot of backend work and testing on them, I do most the performance tests to figure out which 
                    modules are the most lagy for the public server. I have however submitted the TNT landmines module which was an adaption of the 
                    same module from 1.8 but with a lot new features, including different mine types and upgrades.
                    <br />
                    I also Updated a lot of modules for the 1.16 update adding support for netherite to the Metallurgy modules and addons. I also 
                    updated, and bug fixed most its addon modules as well.
                    <br /><br />
                    Most of the updates to modules I do is on the public server and maintain them for it. This including adding a custom clocking 
                    module that reduced the number of modules that were ticking at the same time. I also went through a gave each module on the 
                    server a lag score from 1 to 10 depending on the impact on tps (Ticks per Second) it had, and how much of the tick it took up. 
                    I also am responsible for maintaining the data packs on the server and ensuring they are up-to-date, and any errors are making 
                    it back to the correct person.

                </p>
                <h2>Public System Administation</h2>
                <p>
                    Moreover, I am also one of the main 3 System Admins for Gamemode 4 and out of the 3 am responsible for the main running of the 
                    public server and maintaining its performance. This means I spend lots of time lag busting and optimising the server to run at 
                    20tps even when we have 10 to 20 players. At the start of this season that was especially had as it meant managing it with at 
                    least 20 people on 24/7.
                    <br /><br />
                    As part of my role I also am responsible for making sure the moderation team have the tools they need todo their role. This 
                    including managing the moderation plugins that we have download/ brought in the likes of Core Protect and Lite Bans.
                    <br />
                    On top of that i also have written 2 custom plugins to aid them, these being Datapack Manager which I have since turned into a 
                    fully-fledged plugin of its own. Then there is Gm4Core which we use to add highly needed features like /tpa and /back; 
                    /buildmode; /freeze and player join handling.
                    <br />
                    The /tpa and /back commands allow staff to jump between different locations and back without losing where they were as all the 
                    mods are players too. The /buildmode command was by far the most requested and allows staff to easy access creative mod without 
                    accidently deleting their survival inventory or losing the chest where they put their things. It also remembers where they last 
                    where so they can get back to where they came from. Finally for the commands there is the /freeze command which will freeze all 
                    players on the server for a set time, this will generate a timestamp to unfreeze them at which is not tied to tps or it would 
                    be distorted.
                    <br />
                    As wells as these plugins I also created a nicknames plugin which too has gone onto become its own plugin.
                    <br />
                    When it comes to player handling we use this to check for new players and alert them that we have rules, it also checks that players did 
                    not log out in the 1.15 nether and back in to it, once we reset the next for 1.16.
                </p>
                <h2>Patreon Server</h2>
                <p>
                    I setup the patron server as a way to say thank you to all the gm4 patrons, on this server they get a 4 by 4 chunk of land to work on, they can 
                    expand this claim with surrounding plots. It runs on the same settings as the main server and same modules to give a close recreation for them 
                    to test machines in.
                    <br />
                    For this server I had to create a custom plugin called patreon-controll to allow for better management of datapacks and for patrons to use some 
                    game modes. The better management of datapacks allows patrons to toggle different modules depending on what they need, it also automatically 
                    switches them of when they either no one is on or when they have been left on too long to save on server resources.

                </p>
                <h2>Other servers</h2>
                <p>
                    On top of both these permeant servers I also help manage a server we use for development streams which is just a plain vanilla server. When we 
                    sometimes host gamenights for the patrons/ staff I also help run that server and, in the past, we have done a couple of UHCâ€™s which I helped 
                    organise, run and setup. When setting it up I helped create a custom datapack for it and a custom plugin to add some fancy features.
