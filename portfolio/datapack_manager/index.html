                <h1>The Plugin</h1>
                <p>
                    Datapack manager is a advanced plugin that integrates with GitHub to allow multiple people to steamily work on datapacks.
                    <br />
                    With this plugin you can have as many people working on and updating datapacks on a server with a lower chance of conflict. This also allows 
                    server admins to restrict file access to only the core people needed as everyone else can update the datapacks remotely.

                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Setup/ Installation</h3>
                <p> 
                    To setup this plugin it is extremely easy. Todo so first make sure you are running a spigot-based server, then download the plugin from below and 
                    drop it in your plugins folder.
                    <br />
                    Once this is done start up your server, then open up the plugin config inside of DatapackManager, once in here set the GitHub url to your 
                    repository and the branch you want to use.
                    <br />
                    If it is a private repo, make sure to set a username and password under authentication, SSH does not yet work.
                    <br />
                    Once this has been done navigate back into game and run first "/datapackmanager reload" then "/datapackmanager setup" and follow the in game 
                    instructions, this will do an initial clone of the repo.
                </p>
                <h2>Other commands</h3>
                <p> 
                    The only other command in this is "/gitpull" which will update your datapack folder and reload the server in one go!
                </p>
            </div>

                <h1>What i did</h1>
                <h2>Lead Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I originally created this plugin to automate the datapack file on the gamemode 4 public server and to allow all staff to update the datapack 
                    folder without having to need backend access or having to get me to upload it all the time.
                    <br />
                    By doing this it has allowed us to work a lot better as a team with updating modules and fixing bugs. It also allows us to make pull requests and 
                    review them before they are added, this saves time from constantly download and uploading modules to review them first.
                    <br />
                    Another major benefit of this system was it meant me or any other admin did not have to be around for staff to fix a major bug
                    <br /><br />
                    Within the project it allowed me to learn a lot about file management and integrating git withing Java
